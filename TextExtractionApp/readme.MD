## Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Project
This project focuses on extracting text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques. Once the text is extracted, we apply various basic functions of OpenCV to enhance the extracted text and improve accuracy. This project is designed to be a time-saving solution, eliminating the need for manual typing from images.

# Features
- Extract text from images using OCR algorithms.
- Pre-process the extracted text using OpenCV functions to enhance its quality and readability.
- Improve accuracy by applying image enhancement techniques specific to OCR.
- Support for multiple image formats, including JPG, PNG, and TIFF.
- User-friendly interface with easy-to-use functions for image selection and text extraction.
- Error handling and validation to ensure reliable extraction results.

# Installation
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
- Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Run the application: python app.py
Select an image file for text extraction.
The OCR algorithm will process the image and display the extracted text.
Use the provided OpenCV functions to enhance the extracted text if needed.
Save the final extracted and enhanced text as a text file.
